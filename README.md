<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Lab with Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we are going to creat a lab environment where we are going perform vulnerability assessments on Windows 10 image in a virtual environment with Nessus.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 
- <b>Diskpart</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (22H2)

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>
We need to download the image of the Windows 10 (version 22H2) inorder to run it in the virtual machine software. You can download the image of Windows from the link provided below.

#### [Windows 10 Image](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)

Once you have downloaded the image of the Windows (.iso file), we have to create a virtual environment to run this image. We are going use the VirtualBox to run the image of the Windows.
