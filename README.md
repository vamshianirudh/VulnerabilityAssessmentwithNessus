<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Lab with Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we are going to creat a lab environment where we are going perform vulnerability assessments on Windows 10 image in a virtual environment with Nessus.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 
- <b>Diskpart</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (22H2)

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>
We need to download the image of the Windows 10 (version 22H2) inorder to run it in the virtual machine software. You can download the image of Windows from the link provided below.

Once you have downloaded the image of the Windows (.iso file), we have to create a virtual environment to run this image. We are going use the VirtualBox to run the image of the Windows. And once you have downloaded the iso file, create a virtual machine using the iso file and configure the basic necessary settings to turn up the machine.

After successfully launching the Windows image in the Virtual image, inorder to make a vulnerability assessment we need to make the system more vulnerable. We can make our system vulnerable by turning off some important system settings like system updates, windows firewall and uninstalling any important updates etc.

Inorder to turn off the settings which we have mentioned we need to navigate to the settings in the Windows search bar and follow as guided:

<br />

Our first objective is to pause the automatic updates so that the system doesn't receive any system and security updates. We can do that by extending the date of pause as long as possible, which effectively disables the updates.

<br />

You can extend the pause updates by choosing the longest date possible and also make sure to turn off the update options which are set to on by default.

<br />

Now we have to also make sure that the pre-installed updates are uninstalled so that security patches are removed the system and to make sure the Nessus scanner works more effectively.

<br />

Some updates cannot be uninstalled. To make sure that we can uninstall the updates, select the individual update and see whether you can find the uninstall option at the top. If you cannot find the uninstall option after choosing the update, it means that the particular update cannot be uninstalled.

<br />

Now we need to disable the Windows Defender Firewall.

Make sure you set all the firewall profiles off.

<br />

Finally we need to make sure that the network the virtual machine is on the same network as the Nessus machine that we are about to create. Configure the following settings on your virtual machine and change your adapter setting to "Host-only Adapter" (as it is only option that's working for me):

<h3>Installing Nessus</h3>

Installing Nessus is pretty intuitive as it can get. By clicking on the link provided, you will be redirected to the Nessus Essentials Registration page where you must complete the registration to download the Nessus. After downloading the Nessus and completing the setup wizard, activation code will be sent to your registered email. Use the activation code and let the rest of plugins for Nessus download. 

Note: We will be downloading the Nessus on your personal machine to run vulnerability scans, not your virtual machine which you have setup.
